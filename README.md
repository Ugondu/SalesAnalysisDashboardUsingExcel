## Data Cleaning.
To ensure that the dataset is ready for analysis, I carried out a process of data cleaning, removing errors, inconsistencies, inaccurate information, and text conversion. The following steps were taken to ensure the readiness of the dataset.
* A copy of the data set was created for manipulation, cleaning, data preprocessing and analysis.
* Duplicate rows were removed from the dataset using the “check duplicates” function.
* The dataset was checked for blank cells, and none was present.
* Age group column was created by finding the interval between the maximum and minimum ages and grouping into five bins using the (=IFS) function.
* Month and year columns were created using (=Text(cell), “mmmm”) formula to extrapolate the month and year of purchase from the date column.
* Revenue column was created by multiplying selling price and quantity columns.
* Profit and Loss column was created by subtracting cost price from selling price.
* Profit/loss rate column was created by subtracting cost price from revenue divided by revenue.

## Conclusion and Recommendations
This showcases the effectiveness of analytics tools such as Excel in providing useful insights in available data over a period of time. We recommend more investments in high revenue states such as Lagos to bring in more revenue. Additionally, the company should run a promotion campaign on accessories to customers between ages 32 and 64 as they are the age group with the highest revenue. Finally, we observed a steady growth in revenue between June and October 2015, with a sharp peak between November and December, which could be due to seasonality. This trend is evident as we observed a sharp decline in revenue between may and July 2016.
